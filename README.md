# Hackaton2023
This is our hackathon 2023 project

The problem:
Underestimation of environmental impact of transporation options
Misconception about the inconvenience of public transportation
Lack of incentives for travel with a positive impact on the environment

The solution:
Creating travel routes that weigh environmental parameters
Reflection of different travel considerations (time, direct cost, hidden cost, environmental)
Rating method and providing incentives:
Incentives in the form of a unique currency supported by supporting businesses
User-based rating that reflects different incentive options based on the rating

Business model:
